## What type of executive sponsorship do you have for a 100% cloud adoption?[radios] = 

() No executive sponsorship.
() Sponsorship is from senior management.
() Sponsorship is from one or more C-level executives.
() Comprehensive C-level sponsorship with a shared roadmap for cloud adoption and migration.
() Comprehensive C-level sponsorship consistently sets the tone for a culture of cloud-first adoption across the organization as well as experimentation and innovation within teams.

## What are the success criteria for your cloud team?[radios] = 

() No defined success criteria.
() Successful outcomes include completion of either proofs of concept or 'minimum viable cloud/platform' efforts.
() Successful outcomes and goals include putting one or more workloads into production.
() Successful outcomes include scaling prototypes to operating the core technical services in the cloud that are consumed by business-critical applications.
() The organization has success criteria that encourages cloud-based innovation and experimentation, and that ensures the creation of value through transformation initiatives aligned with the organizationâ€™s goals and strategy.


## Which of the following is your predominant means of provisioning cloud services?[radios] = 

() Manually or imperatively provisioned by the console/portal/CLI or other tool.
() Cloud services are provisioned with limited scripting. There are no formal standards or consistency in how scripting is implemented across project teams.
() Some cloud services are provisioned via declarative automation for the full lifecycle, but this is not consistent across all project teams.
() Most project teams use declarative automation for cloud services provisioning.
() Declaratively defined automation for cloud services provisioning is mandated for all production services and only executed from CI/CD.

## How do you release updates to your applications and services?[radios] = 

() Shut down production, update applications in place, and restart. Roll back from backups if needed.
() Use rolling updates to perform updates in place with some impact on production capacity, usually during a maintenance window.
() Deploy a new version of the application without impacting existing production with a manual cut-over during a maintenance window. Manually fall back to the prior version if needed.
() Utilize a canary or blue/green strategy with manual transition between current and new versions. Formal maintenance windows are not routinely required.
() Utilize a canary or blue/green strategy and dynamically transition users to and from the new versions. Formal maintenance windows are not required.

## CI/CD: How comprehensive is your CI/CD tooling?[radios] = 

() No CI/CD tooling in place and projects employ traditional build/test/deploy practices.
() Some projects make limited use of CI/CD tooling. There are no formal standards in place.
() Many project teams use CI/CD tooling based on project team preference.
() Most project teams use CI/CD tooling based on project team preference, with very limited use of traditional build/test/deploy practices.
() Standardized CI/CD pipeline used consistently by project teams across the organization by consent.

## What does the majority of your current technology stack look like?[radios] = 

() Monolithic applications with a wide technology stack, each deployed as a single unit.
() Applications are split into modules, providing greater flexibility for development, but such modules may not be deployable as individual components.
() Applications are modularized such that each of the individual components are self-contained and individually deployable. Significant dependencies exist, which adds complexity to the testing.
() Most application components can be deployed and tested independently, but one or more core components of the system are still based on a monolithic stack.
() Applications consistently utilize a component-based modular architecture. All components can be tested and deployed independently. No monolithic stack dependencies exist.

## What is your approach to using compute services in the cloud?[radios] = 

() Workloads are always deployed in long-running homogeneous sized VMs.
() Most workloads are deployed in long-running VMs, right-sizing only increases the compute demand. There is some limited experimentation with containers or function-based services for noncritical workloads.
() Some production workloads running in containers or function-based compute. There is some ad-hoc use of short-lived VMs based on workload characteristics and these are right-sized with no default VM size.
() Regularly use short-lived VMs or containers. There is some use of function-based compute services or containers.
() The selection of cloud services is driven by a 'fit for purpose' approach, rigorous right-sizing is continually applied, evaluation of solution is exactly: SaaS > FaaS (serverless) > Containers as a Service > Platform/orchestrator as a Service > Infra as a Service.

## How does the shared responsibility model factor in to your cloud consumption?[radios] =
() .
() .
() .
() .
() The shared responsibility model is a critical factor taken into decision making for cloud consumption and regularly revisited to ensure the best value for money is being sought from the cloud vendor.


## Builds and deployments: How do you ensure that your applications are built and deployed in a timely manner?[radios] =

() .
() .

## How are build artifacts created and stored ?[radios] =
() .
() .
() .
() All dependencies are tightly pinned to a specific version with cryptographic signing or hashes.
() Immutable build artifacts are created and cryptographically signed at least all artifacts that are deployed to production are kept in immutable storage for a 

## How would you describe your branch strategy?[radios] =
() Limited use of version control
() .
() .
() Using a text book implementation of GitFlow
() Using a text book implementation of GitHubFlow


## How would you describe your deployment + QA pipeline?[radios] =
() Manual scheduled QA process
() .
() .
() .
() Short lived ephemeral environments provisioned on demand

## Cloud Management[radios] =
() Manual click-ops, manual documentation of steps followed is captured.
() .
() .
() .
() Fully managed by code with continual automated drift detection alerts in place and treated as significant incidents.

## How do you manage updating the access policies and controls and communicating that?[radios] =

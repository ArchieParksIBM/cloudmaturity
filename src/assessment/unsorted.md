() **Comprehensive C-Level Sponsorship with Roadmap:** Full sponsorship from C-level executives, accompanied by a shared, strategic roadmap for cloud adoption and migration.
() **C-Level Sponsorship Driving Cloud-First Culture:** Comprehensive C-level sponsorship not only provides strategic direction but also actively fosters a culture of cloud-first adoption, experimentation, and innovation throughout the organization.

## What are the success criteria for your cloud team?[radios] =

() **No Defined Success Criteria:** The cloud team operates without specific, defined criteria for measuring success.
() **Initial Achievements with Proofs of Concept:** Success is measured by completing initial proofs of concept or developing a 'minimum viable cloud/platform'.
() **Launching Workloads in Production:** Success includes transitioning one or more workloads into a live production environment on the cloud.
() **Scaling Prototypes to Core Services:** Success involves scaling initial prototypes to operate core technical services in the cloud, supporting business-critical applications.
() **Innovation and Value Creation Alignment:** The organization has established success criteria that not only focus on cloud-based innovation and experimentation but also on creating tangible value through transformation initiatives, all aligned with the organizationâ€™s broader goals and strategy.

## What is your primary method for provisioning cloud services?[radios] =

() **Manual or Imperative Provisioning:** Cloud services are primarily provisioned manually through consoles, portals, CLI, or other tools, without significant automation.
() **Limited Scripting with No Standards:** Provisioning involves some scripting, but there are no formal standards or consistency across project teams.
() **Partial Declarative Automation:** Declarative automation is used for provisioning some cloud services across their lifecycle, but this practice is not uniform across all teams.
() **Widespread Use of Declarative Automation:** Most project teams employ declarative automation for cloud service provisioning, indicating a higher level of maturity in automation practices.
() **Mandatory Declarative Automation via CI/CD:** Declarative automation is mandated for provisioning all production services, and it is exclusively executed through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## How does your organization release updates to its applications and services?[radios] =

() **Downtime for Updates:** Updates are applied by shutting down production, updating applications in place, and restarting. Rollbacks rely on backups if needed.
() **Rolling Updates During Maintenance Windows:** Updates are performed using rolling updates, impacting production capacity to some extent, usually scheduled during maintenance windows.
() **Manual Cut-Over with New Versions:** New versions of applications are deployed without impacting existing production, with a manual transition to the new version during a maintenance window. Manual rollback to the previous version is possible if needed.
() **Canary or Blue/Green Strategy with Manual Transition:** Updates are released using a canary or blue/green strategy, allowing manual transition between current and new versions. Formal maintenance windows are not routinely necessary.
() **Dynamic Canary/Blue/Green Strategy without Maintenance Windows:** Updates are managed via a canary or blue/green strategy with dynamic transitioning of users between versions. This approach eliminates the need for formal maintenance windows.

## How does your organization approach the use of compute services in the cloud?[radios] =

() **Long-Running Homogeneous VMs:** Workloads are consistently deployed on long-running, homogeneously sized Virtual Machines (VMs), without variation or optimization.
() **Primarily Long-Running VMs with Limited Experimentation:** Most workloads are on long-running VMs, with some limited experimentation in containers or function-based services for non-critical tasks.
() **Mixed Use with Some Advanced Compute Options:** Some production workloads are run in containers or function-based compute services. Ad-hoc use of short-lived VMs is practiced, with efforts to right-size based on workload needs.
() **Regular Use of Short-Lived VMs and Containers:** There is regular use of short-lived VMs and containers, along with some function-based compute services. This indicates a move towards more flexible and scalable compute options.
() **'Fit for Purpose' Approach with Rigorous Right-Sizing:** Cloud services selection is driven by a strict 'fit for purpose' approach. This includes a rigorous continual right-sizing process and a solution evaluation hierarchy favoring SaaS > FaaS > Containers as a Service > Platform/Orchestrator as a Service > Infrastructure as a Service.

## How does the shared responsibility model influence your organization's approach to cloud consumption?[radios] =

() **Minimal Consideration of Shared Responsibility:** The shared responsibility model is not a primary factor in cloud consumption decisions, often leading to misunderstandings or gaps in responsibility.

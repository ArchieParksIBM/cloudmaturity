## What is the structure of your organization in terms of managing cloud operations?[radios] =

() **Developer-Managed Cloud Operations:** There is no dedicated cloud team; application developers are responsible for managing all aspects of cloud operations.
() **Fully Outsourced Cloud Operations and Strategy:** All cloud operations, including the definition of strategic direction, are outsourced to a third-party supplier.
() **Outsourced Operations with Internal Strategic Ownership:** Cloud operations are outsourced, but the strategic direction for cloud usage is developed and owned internally by the department.
() **Hybrid Approach with Outsourced Augmentation:** A mix of in-house and outsourced resources is used. Third-party suppliers provide additional capabilities (e.g., on-call support), while strategic cloud direction is led by departmental leaders.
() **Dedicated In-House Cloud Team:** A robust, dedicated cloud team exists within the organization, comprising at least 5 civil/public servant employees per cloud platform. This team has a shared roadmap for cloud capabilities, adoption, and migration.

## How is your organization structured to develop and implement its cloud vision and strategy?[radios] =

() **No Dedicated Cloud Team:** There is no specific team focusing on cloud strategy; teams operate in silos based on traditional, on-premises role definitions.
() **Informal Cloud Expertise:** Informal groups or individuals with cloud expertise exist, facilitating some degree of cross-organizational collaboration.
() **Formal Cross-Functional Cloud Team/COE:** A formal Cloud Center of Excellence or equivalent cross-functional team exists, providing foundational support and guidance for cloud operations.
() **Integrated Cloud Teams Following COE Standards:** Cloud teams across the organization follow standards and patterns established by the Cloud COE. Cross-functional roles are increasingly common within development teams.
() **Advanced Cloud COE Operating Model:** The Cloud COE has matured into a comprehensive operating model with fully autonomous, cross-functional teams that include experts in all necessary technology and process domains.

## How does your organization monitor and observe its cloud infrastructure and application data?[radios] =

() **Reactive and Development-Focused Observation:** Observations are primarily made during the development phase or in response to issues, with no continuous monitoring in place.
() **Basic Monitoring Tools and Manual Checks:** Basic monitoring tools are used. Checks are often manual and are not fully integrated across different cloud services.
() **Systematic Monitoring with Alerts:** Systematic monitoring is in place with alert systems for potential issues. However, the integration of infrastructure and application data is still developing.
() **Advanced Monitoring with Partial Integration:** Advanced monitoring tools are used, providing more comprehensive data. There's a degree of integration between infrastructure and application monitoring, but it's not fully seamless.
() **Integrated 'Single Pane of Glass' Monitoring:** A sophisticated, integrated monitoring system is in place, offering a 'single pane of glass' view. This system provides actionable insights from both infrastructure and application data.

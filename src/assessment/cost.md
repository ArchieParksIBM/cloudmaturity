## What approaches does your organization use to plan, measure, and optimize cloud spending?[radios] =

() **Restricted Billing Visibility:** Billing details are only accessible to management and finance teams, with limited transparency across the organization.
() **Proactive Spend Commitment by Finance:** The finance team uses billing information to make informed decisions about pre-committed cloud spending where it's deemed beneficial.
() **Cost-Effective Resource Management:** Cloud environments and applications are configured for cost-efficiency, such as automatically shutting down or scaling down non-production environments during off-hours.
() **Cost-Aware Development Practices:** Developers and engineers have daily visibility into cloud costs and are encouraged to consider the financial impact of their choices in the development phase.
() **Comprehensive Cost Management and Optimization:** Multi-tier spend alerts are configured to notify various levels of the business for immediate action. Developers and engineers regularly review and prioritize changes to improve cost-effectiveness significantly.

## How does your organization allocate capacity for production workloads in the cloud?[radios] =

() **Peak Provisioning:** Capacity is typically provisioned based on peak usage estimates, potentially leading to underutilization during off-peak times.
() **Manual Scaling Based on Average Consumption:** Capacity is provisioned for average usage, with manual scaling adjustments made seasonally or as needed.
() **Basic Autoscaling for Certain Components:** Autoscaling is enabled for some cloud components, primarily based on simple capacity or utilization metrics.
() **Widespread Autoscaling with Basic Metrics:** Autoscaling is a common practice, although it mainly utilizes basic metrics, with limited use of log or application-specific metrics.
() **Advanced Autoscaling Using Detailed Metrics:** Autoscaling is ubiquitously used, based on sophisticated log or application metrics, allowing for highly responsive and efficient capacity allocation.

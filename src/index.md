## Cloud Maturity Model and Assessment Tool

This interactive tool helps UK public sector teams gauge where they stand on a spectrum of cloud adoption and practices—covering everything from version control to cost management, security, and operational resilience. It’s designed to deliver **immediate, actionable guidance**, highlighting concrete steps you can take to mature your cloud usage in line with best practices from industry standards, [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/), and [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/).

1. **Answer Targeted Questions**  
   The tool presents a range of topics, each with five potential answers that reflect different levels of maturity. Simply select what **best describes your current approach**.

2. **Receive Direct, Customised Advice**  
   Each answer triggers specific next steps—whether you’re running a small proof-of-concept or managing a large-scale, mission-critical service. **Scoring “low” isn’t always bad:** sometimes a “just enough” approach is perfectly balanced for your context, especially if you’re managing a smaller or less critical environment.

3. **Focus on Realistic Improvements**  
   Every recommendation is **rapidly actionable**, pointing to official guidance, vendor-native solutions, and relevant public sector resources. Our intent is to help you close gaps, reduce risk, and adapt swiftly to evolving user needs.

4. **Not an Assurance Tool**  
   The tool **doesn’t collect or audit results**—it’s about supporting you in identifying where you are, what risks you face, and how best to progress. Whether your service is as vital as passport validation or as simple as a canteen menu listing, the Cloud Maturity Model can help you focus on the right improvements.

**Status:** Currently in alpha, and we warmly welcome community feedback and contributions. Explore, experiment, and if you spot areas to refine, please raise a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/co-cddo/cloudmaturity).
